# Christian Kesler on Github

I am Christian Kesler, a Software Engineer who specializes in Web Applications built using NodeJS or Laravel.  

During my time at Trailhead Marketing from Mar2022 to Jun2022, I created a fully custom Laravel server deployed to AWS that served as an inhouse CRM.  Shortly after I arrived, the legacy server collapsed due to a slew of deprecated dependencies.  Since I was rather inexperienced at the time (and was the only developer in the company), I opted to build something new from the ground up.  In less than 4 weeks, I was able to deploy a functional prototype CRM that interfaced with the legacy database and the Facebook API to the production environment.  Features included new client creation, existing client management, email generation and sending, a user authentication system, a sales team performance tracker, and client billing.

I completed my B.Sc. at SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University) while maintaining a 4.0 GPA in May of 2022.

During my time as a student, I created a live website that contains my professional ePortfolio, which can be found at https://kwoe.uglesoft.com/eportfolio.html.  The projects utilized towards my collegiate capstone are detailed within that ePortfolio.

## Python Experience

I've created miscellaneous Python programs throughout the past to serve specific purposes.  File manipulation is a common usecase, but the projects I've documented and can showcase include a three part video series you can view here:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYrMngyd6OmT6hxpv-_CFq_JlnA7LoQiL

This youtube tutorial details a Python program that listens for custom key combinations and executes keystrokes as a result.  I've used a variant of this program to routinely clean up specific directories, rearrange massive spreadsheets, speed up my general computer usage by typing out common output (such as my email address), and setup my desktop each morning.  

Python is a very powerful language that can do a lot of things.  I've been focusing more on specializing in languages that serve more narrow purposes (Javascript and PHP), but I'm no stranger to Python and always enjoy learning new things.  

I have some rather large ambitions, and would like to explore neural networks and basic ML in Python at some point.  


## Javascript Experience

Javascript is my bread and butter.  My very first website (which I built in a self taught manner while attending college) utilized a hosting service that served static files.  Due to this, I had no choice but to build every single dynamic feature on the server frontend.  You can check it out here:  https://kwoe.uglesoft.com/

While it is rather basic, one key highlights include api integration (this was my first ever encounter with an api): https://kwoe.uglesoft.com/caped-crusaders/5e-srd-spells.html

During my time at Trailhead Marketing in Phoenix AZ, I created a rather large javascript function to post custom templated advertisements to the Facebook Graph API.

While my current position mandates discretion, I can openly discuss the work I have been doing on my personal time.  I recently published my first NodeJS package to NPM.  It handles authentication with hashed passwords and utilizes a SQLite database connection.  Check it out here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ugle-auth

## PHP Experience

At Trailhead Marketing, I built a CRM in Laravel from scratch that was able to interface with a legacy database, send pre-generated emails, manage a large number of Facebook advertisements, and handle client billing systems (recurring subscriptions and one time payments).  This project was a top priority after the previous system crashed from numerous deprecated dependencies requiring an update that made them incompatible, and I was able to push a functional prototype to production that resumed business operations in less than 4 weeks.  

## SQL Experience

Most of my web applications work with a database of some kind, typically SQL based.  I've worked with MySQL in a LAMP stack (Laravel, Apache, MySQL, PHP).  I recently began using SQLite via NodeJS and have found it extremely to my liking.


## Other Experience

I own my own small business, Uglesoft LLC, which offers website creation and hosting solutions to small businesses.  I am currently working on a revamped website for Uglesoft, and have a client with a live website.  There are planned features coming in the near future, but you can view it as is here:  https://jaguarfitnessaz.com/
